  alpha-0.0.4 release.
  [#25] Empty CSRF token creates hickups.
  Added initial GPG/PGP support. Still experimental.
  Added phpsecLog class to add better logging support.  
    This means that phpsec::init() has to be called before setting the log dir:
    phpsecLog::$_logdir = 'filesystem:/var/www/phpSec/logs';
    Also phpsec::log() is now phpsecLog::log().
  Added syslog support to phpsecLog.
  phpsec::f() now accepts strings a array of data to filter.
  Improved error handling.
  phpsecCrypt::encrypt() performance improvements.
  Greatly improved key generation security in phpsecCrypt().
    This means that data encrypted with phpSec alpha-0.0.3 and older will not
    decrypt in this version.
